# Sean Dorff's Temp File Remover
This tool cleans up the folder that Microsoft Disk Cleanup misses.  
The covered directories are:
1. In the `Windows` directory:
   1. `Prefetch`
   2. `Temp`
2. In the current user's profile directory:
   1. `AppData\Local\Temp`

The program will run with the highest privileges currently available.
